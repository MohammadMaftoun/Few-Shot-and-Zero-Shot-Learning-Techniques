# Few-Shot-and-Zero-Shot-Learning-Techniques

# Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing few-shot and zero-shot learning techniquesâ€”two advanced methods in machine learning that address the challenges of limited labeled data.

    Few-shot learning: A technique where models learn to make predictions with only a small number of labeled examples. This is especially useful in scenarios where gathering large datasets is impractical or expensive.

    Zero-shot learning: This method allows models to perform tasks without having seen any examples of the task or class. Instead, the model generalizes knowledge from similar tasks or semantic relationships, enabling it to recognize and act on unseen categories.

Through this repository, we aim to provide implementations, tutorials, and insights into leveraging these techniques for real-world applications. By using meta-learning, transfer learning, and large pre-trained models, we strive to develop robust solutions for scenarios with limited data.

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the repository:

# Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.8 or later
    PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model you plan to use)
    Additional libraries as listed in the requirements.txt file
Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/few-shot-zero-shot-learning.git
cd few-shot-zero-shot-learning

Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment (optional but recommended):

Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies:

bash

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # for Unix/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate  # for Windows

Usage
Training a Few-Shot Model

To train a few-shot learning model on your own dataset:

bash

python train_few_shot.py --dataset <your-dataset> --model <model-name>

Example:

bash

python train_few_shot.py --dataset miniImageNet --model ProtoNet

Zero-Shot Learning Example

For a zero-shot learning task, use the following command:

bash

python zero_shot.py --model <model-name> --task <task-name>

Example:

bash

python zero_shot.py --model CLIP --task image-classification
